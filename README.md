# cub3D
Simple program realises game like Return to Castle Wolfenstein for macOs.
It uses DDA algorithm for ray casting and minilibX lib for graphics out .
This cub3D project made by myself for School 42

Type 'make' for compile to make 'cub3D' executable file.

To run game type './cub3D some_map.cub' there some_map is a file of gamemap with .cub extention

Examples of mapfile with errors and working map are in 'maps' folder

Type './cub3D maps/map01.cub' to play real game

Sorry, this is not complete game - just draft, but it works!
